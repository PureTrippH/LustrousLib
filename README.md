# LustrousLib
## What is this Project
This project is the backbone behind all of my plugins. Essentially, it is a standardization of Command Handling, Config Parsing, and a variety of different plugin essentially. This library also hosts a variety of different spacial data structures, graph algorithms, and even some computational geometry stuff.
